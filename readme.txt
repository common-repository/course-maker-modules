Course Maker Modules adds a Custom Post Type called "Modules" for you to use as Course content on any Genesis HTML5 theme. Designed for the Course Maker theme by brandiD. Based on the "Genesis Portfolio Pro" plugin by StudioPress.

== Description ==

Course Maker Modules will add a new "Modules" post type (just like Blog Posts) to act as your Course content.

The default template and styles will create a Module Archive page showing your Modules in a grid format. These will link to a Single Module page where you can control the content including text, images, and even galleries.

To get started click "add new" under the new "Modules" menu item to add your first Module. Simply add your images and content just like you already know how to do with posts, and Publish. Add a few more entries to build your Module archive and show off your work in an attractive grid.

== Installation ==

Download the latest version of the Course Maker Modules plugin and upload as a new plugin within your WordPress dashboard or via FTP to the wp-content/plugins folder and then activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What can I customize in the modules? =

Custom templates are supported using the WordPress template hierarchy and the module featured image size can be overridden by adding `add_image_size( 'modules', 300, 200, TRUE );` to your theme functions.php file. There are many other tricks you can use with the Genesis actions and filters to customize anything in the plugin output.
